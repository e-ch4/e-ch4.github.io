    I have always been passionate about finding treatments and cures to medical
    conditions, common or rare. Eternally a student, I'm excited about always
    learning and being pushed to learn in order to rise to each challenge.
    Initially coming from a background in Biology, I discovered my passion of
    applying computational skills and quantitative analysis to biological
    problems during my undergraduate time at MIT. <br />
